                <h2>About our kitchens</h2>
                <h3>What do you mean by a “bespoke kitchen”?</h3>
                <p>All of our kitchens are built from scratch in our carpentry studio outside of S. This gives you the opportunity to create a unique, bespoke kitchen entirely from scratch.</p>
                <p>All kitchens can be fully tailored to your wishes and the state of the room. We don’t rely on standard sizes: if a cabinet needs to be 622 mm, we’ll make it 622 mm. That means we never have to compromise on design.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Whats included in a kitchen?</h3>
                <p>Our kitchens are built with 19mm frames upholstered in gray or white melamine and doors made of a high-quality foiled mdf, painted in any color.</p>
                <p>Drawers from Blum, can be chosen in gray or white lacquered metal. As an option, you can choose veneered inside in oak or ash on the frames, veneered door and also solid wooden drawers in oak or ash. </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>How much can I customize the kitchen?</h3>
                <p>All of our kitchens are built entirely from scratch in our own carpentry studio in Gothenburg. This means that every single element is of exceptional craftsmanship and carefully quality-controlled. Because we make everything ourselves, it means we are very flexible about special requests. We can build most kinds of kitchens, specially tailored to exact measurements, materials, and design aesthetics to suit your particular taste and personal preferences. We don’t rely on standard measurements and materials — you get to choose everything yourself from a large selection of colors, materials and designs.</p>

                <h2>Order and prices</h2>
                <h3>How much is a bespoke kitchen?</h3>
                <p>To give you an approximate estimate for one of our kitchens, you’ll find pricing examples here. Please note, however, that each kitchen we make is entirely unique and thus so is the price. The final sum depends on how large your kitchen space is, how many special solutions are needed, the number of cabinets required and which cabinet interior you finally choose. See example prices.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>How does payment work?</h3>
                <p>30% of the total cost is paid within 10 days after the initial order. The remainder shall be paid no later than one week before the kitchen is delivered. We also offer partial payment options through Vasa credit.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Does Nordiska kök has showrooms?</h3>
                <p>On Ekerö outside of Stockholm, you find our Concept showroom. At the moment we do not have the possibility for drop-in visits, all visits are booked by your assigned kitchen designer. </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Do you have your own network of installers?</h3>
                <p>Our network of craftsmen and carpenters are only available in S at the moment. Therefore you, as a customer, must work with a local installer in your country. We recommend you to make sure they are well-acquainted with installing bespoke kitchens. The end result depends on quality installation and there is a significant difference between installing mass-produced kitchens as opposed to fully-customized bespoke ones like we produce.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Do you make home visits?</h3>
                <p>We always strive to be as cost-conscious as possible so that our customers can have their fully-customized bespoke kitchen at a reasonable price. One part of this process is that our customers are the ones who measure the dimensions of the space themselves. Don’t worry, though; we have a simple measurement template that makes it quick and easy. You’ll receive the template from your personal kitchen designer once we begin the design process.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Do you have information in local European languages? </h3>
                <p>At the moment all information and communication to and from us is in English, which includes all personal contact with your kitchen designer, all measurement information, cost estimate and mounting information, agreement and Terms & Conditions.</p>
