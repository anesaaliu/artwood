                  <h3>The Design Process</h3>
                  <h1>Four Simple Steps to Your New Kitchen</h1>
                  <p>Building a bespoke kitchen shouldn’t be complicated or expensive. That’s why we at ArtWood have made it easy. One of our kitchen designers will be helping you every step of the way, from idea to finished kitchen, tailored to your needs.</p>
                  <p>In the four simple steps below you can read about our process.</p>

                      <h3>1. Initial Contact</h3>
                      <p>Start by <a href="contact.html">filling out your contact details</a>.</p>
                      <p>We'll get back to you directly via email with a link where you can specify your preferences for your new kitchen as well as the measurements of the room if you have them ready. This forms the basis when our design team starts planning and designing your new kitchen.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="step">
                      <h3>2. Design & Quotation</h3>
                      <p>In the next step, a digital start-up meeting is scheduled with one of our experienced kitchen designers. Together, you go through your wishes and ideas. After the meeting, you'll receive a free of charge and fully customized design sketch as well as a quotation.</p>
                      <p>Once you've received your design sketch, you're welcome to visit our Concept Showroom, or if you prefer to have colour and material samples sent to your home, that's perfectly fine too.</p>

                  <div class="step">
                      <h3>3. Placing an Order</h3>
                      <p>Together with your kitchen designer, the kitchen is tailored down to the smallest detail, both in terms of design and function. Once this is approved by you, your kitchen designer places the order, and your kitchen is built in our carpentry studio outside S.</p>

                      <h3>4. Delivery</h3>
                      <p>Your kitchen leaves our carpentry studio approximately 6-8 weeks after the order is placed. The kitchen is delivered with pre-assembled and installed drawer systems.</p>
                      <p>We always provide a 10-year guarantee on cabinets, drawers, and fittings.</p>
